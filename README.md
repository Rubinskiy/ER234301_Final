# Overview

Our final project is a mobile application that allows students to create events and post them to a community of students who are interested in the event. The application is built using Flutter and Firebase.

In this project, we implemented the following design patterns:
- Proxy Pattern: Primarily in use for the event creation feature, where only verified students can create events.
- Observer Pattern: Primarily in use for the event reminder feature, where students are notified about the event.

# Proxy Pattern

## Overview

Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

## Implementation

Database queries can be really slow.

A proxy is a wrapper around the original object. It can perform additional actions before or after the request gets through to the original object.

# Observer Pattern

## Overview

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

## Implementation

Image on the left is a customer visiting the store every day to check if the product they want is available.
Image on the right is the store sending emails every time a new product is available.

A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications.
